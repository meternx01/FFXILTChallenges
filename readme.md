# Final Fantasy XI: Limited Time Challenges

This Android application displays the current Limited Time Challenge and the time remaining. Additionally, it shows the next three challenges and their start times.

## Requirements

- Minimum Android version: Android 12 (API 31)

## Limitations and Possible Improvements

Currently, the app is a single-page application with no settings. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- **Settings Pane**: Introduce user customization options, such as:
    - Adjust the number of upcoming challenges displayed.
    - Set a time offset for Private Server (Catseye).

- **Enhanced Challenge Information**: Expand the details shown for upcoming challenges when clicked.

- **Notifications**: Implement notifications for challenges, such as "Gain Experience." Decide whether to notify by individual challenge time or by challenge type.
